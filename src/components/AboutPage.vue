        <p class="text-base md:text-xl pb-5">
          I'm a developer, designer, and student based in Paran√°, Brazil. My
          passion for technology fuels my constant quest to learn new
          programming skills. I'm enthusiastic about how technology and
          programming can transform our world, and I'm dedicated to continually
          growing in this exciting field.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold pb-2">Design</h1>
        <p class="text-base md:text-xl pb-5">
          Since 2019, I've gained over four years of experience in design,
          working on a variety of projects from social media to corporate
          design, including creating compelling visual identities. I've had a
          deep interest in art from a young age and have always channeled my
          creativity into my work.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold pb-2">Development</h1>
        <p class="text-base md:text-xl pb-5">
          In 2021, I started an exciting journey into programming by enrolling
          at the Federal Technologic University of Paran√°. Since then, my
          passion for technology and coding has grown immensely, leading me to
          dive deep into web development. In 2023, I began my career as a
          Fullstack Developer at FiqOn. There, I also got the chance to work as
          a Software Project Manager on the Systems Integration team. Now, I‚Äôm
          currently working as a Frontend Developer on the product team.
